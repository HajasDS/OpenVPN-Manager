# openvpn-manager

An interactive, menu-driven terminal tool (whiptail/dialog TUI) to **install, configure and maintain an OpenVPN server** on Linux — with certificate, password, **TOTP** and **YubiKey OTP** authentication.

Conceptually a successor to [`angristan/openvpn-install`](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install): same proven OpenVPN mechanics, but modular, menu-driven, with multi-factor authentication and persistent management state. See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the full comparison.

## Supported operating systems

| Tier | OS | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 / 24.04+ | fully targeted |
| Primary | Debian 11 / 12+ | fully targeted |
| Secondary | Fedora, RHEL / Rocky / Alma 8+ | EPEL enabled automatically for PAM modules |
| Secondary | Arch / Manjaro | best effort |
| Best effort | Other apt / dnf / pacman derivatives | warns before continuing |

Requirements: systemd, bash ≥ 4, a TUN device (`/dev/net/tun` — enable it for LXC/containers first), OpenVPN ≥ 2.5 (all supported distros ship it).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HajasDS/OpenVPN.git openvpn-manager
cd openvpn-manager
chmod +x openvpn-manager.sh
sudo ./openvpn-manager.sh
```

Everything else is interactive. The tool detects your distribution and package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `pacman`), installs its own dependencies (including `whiptail` if no TUI backend is present), and walks you through the setup:

1. **Network interface** and **public endpoint** (auto-detected, incl. public-IP lookup behind NAT; manual override supported)
2. **IPv6** in-tunnel support (offered when the host has public IPv6)
3. **Port** and **protocol** (UDP recommended, TCP available)
4. **DNS for clients** (Cloudflare / Google / Quad9 / AdGuard / OpenDNS / system / custom)
5. Confirmation summary → packages, PKI (ECDSA P-256), server config, IP forwarding, firewall/NAT, service start
6. First VPN user

### Files the tool manages

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/etc/openvpn/server/server.conf` | generated server config (never edit by hand — regenerated) |
| `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/` | PKI (CA, certs, keys, CRL) |
| `/etc/openvpn-manager/config.conf` | persistent tool configuration (`0600`, example in `examples/`) |
| `/etc/openvpn-manager/clients/*.ovpn` | generated client profiles (`0600`) |
| `/etc/openvpn-manager/totp/<user>` | per-user TOTP secret files (`0400`) |
| `/etc/openvpn-manager/yubikey/authorized_yubikeys` | user → YubiKey public-ID map |
| `/etc/openvpn-manager/backups/<timestamp>/` | automatic pre-change backups |
| `/etc/pam.d/openvpn` | generated PAM stack for the active auth mode |
| `/var/log/openvpn-manager.log` | operations log (never contains secrets) |

## Usage

Run `sudo ./openvpn-manager.sh` any time — it is safe to re-run; it detects the existing installation and opens the management menu:

- **User management** — add users (optional key passphrase), revoke (cert + account + TOTP + YubiKey + profile in one step), list with status flags, regenerate `.ovpn` profiles, set/change VPN passwords.
- **Authentication** — switch auth mode, manage TOTP and YubiKeys, toggle username↔certificate matching.
- **Service control** — status with live connected-client list, start/stop/restart, journal view.
- **Server configuration** — change port, protocol, client DNS, public endpoint. Config files are regenerated from persisted state, firewall rules are updated, and you're offered a profile regeneration.
- **Firewall / NAT** — view, re-apply or remove the VPN rules.
- **Backups** — every modified file is snapshotted first to a timestamped folder.
- **Uninstall** — full cleanup with a final backup archive in `/root` (see below).

Client `.ovpn` files land in `/etc/openvpn-manager/clients/`. Transfer them over a secure channel (`scp`), then consider deleting them from the server — they contain the user's private key.

## Authentication modes

A **valid client certificate is always required**. On top of it you choose one server-wide mode:

| Mode | Second factor(s) | Client login experience |
|---|---|---|
| Certificate only *(default)* | — | connects silently |
| Certificate + password | system password (hash in `/etc/shadow`) | username + password prompt |
| Certificate + password + TOTP | password **and** 6-digit TOTP | username + password, then TOTP code prompt |
| Certificate + YubiKey OTP | YubiKey touch | username, password field = key touch |
| Certificate + password + YubiKey | password **and** YubiKey touch | username + password, then key touch prompt |

How it works under the hood (full detail in [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)):

- Password modes create a **locked-down system account** per user: no home, `nologin` shell, dedicated `openvpn-users` group; `pam_succeed_if` restricts VPN login to that group. Passwords are set via `chpasswd` (never on a command line) and stored only as hashes.
- OpenVPN uses the standard `openvpn-plugin-auth-pam.so` plugin against a generated `/etc/pam.d/openvpn` stack. Multi-factor prompts are transported with OpenVPN's `static-challenge` (SCRV1) mechanism — requires OpenVPN ≥ 2.5 on both ends.
- By default the username **must match the certificate CN** (`auth-user-pass-verify` check), so one user's certificate cannot be combined with another user's password.
- Every authentication action **validates its prerequisites first** (packages, PAM plugin, API credentials, user/enrollment state, file permissions). Anything missing is shown with the reason and one-tap fix options instead of failing or hanging midway — see [docs/PREREQUISITES.md](docs/PREREQUISITES.md).

## TOTP setup guide

Works with Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Aegis, Authy, FreeOTP, and any RFC 6238 app.

1. `Authentication → Change authentication mode → Password + TOTP`
   (installs `libpam-google-authenticator` automatically)
2. `Authentication → TOTP management → Generate` — pick the user.
   A **QR code** is drawn in the terminal (plus the base32 secret for manual entry). Shown once, never logged, screen cleared afterwards.
3. The user scans it with their authenticator app.
4. Regenerate + redistribute the user's `.ovpn` when prompted.
5. Login = username, password, then the 6-digit code at the challenge prompt.

Policy options in the TOTP menu:

- **Mandatory vs. per-user** — by default every user must have TOTP; the *per-user-optional* toggle (`nullok`) lets non-enrolled users log in with password only.
- **Reset** (new secret, e.g. lost phone) and **Disable** per user.

## YubiKey OTP setup guide

YubiKey OTP is validated **online** — every touch emits a different one-time code; it is *never* treated as a static password.

1. Choose a validation service in `Authentication → YubiKey management → Configure`:
   - **YubiCloud** (default): free API key from <https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/> — needs outbound HTTPS from the server, or
   - **self-hosted** `yubikey-val`-compatible server URL.
2. **Register** each user's key — they touch it once; the tool extracts the 12-char public ID, verifies the OTP online, and stores the `user:publicid` mapping.
3. **Validate a test OTP** to confirm the whole chain end-to-end.
4. Enable a YubiKey auth mode and redistribute the regenerated profiles.

Multiple keys per user are supported (backup key). Removing a key is one menu action.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Service won't start | `Service → journal`; the tool shows the journal automatically on failed restarts. Backups of the previous config are under `/etc/openvpn-manager/backups/`. |
| Client connects, no internet | `Firewall → Show rules`; another tool may have flushed them → `Re-apply`. Verify `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward` = 1. |
| `AUTH_FAILED` (password modes) | User in `openvpn-users` group with a password set? `User management → List` shows `pw:set/locked`. Username must equal the certificate name (CN-match is on by default). |
| `AUTH_FAILED` (TOTP) | Server *and* phone clock in sync (NTP!). Client profile regenerated after enabling TOTP (needs the `static-challenge` line)? |
| `AUTH_FAILED` (YubiKey) | `YubiKey management → Validate a test OTP`. Outbound HTTPS available? Key registered for exactly this username? |
| Client prompt asks only for password, not the code | Old `.ovpn` — regenerate profiles after any auth-mode change. |
| Behind NAT | Endpoint must be the *public* IP/DNS name; forward the chosen port (UDP by default) to the server. |
| Container (LXC/Proxmox) | TUN device must be enabled for the container. |

## Security notes

Highlights (full write-up in [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)):

- Modern-only crypto: ECDSA P-256 PKI, AES-256-GCM/ChaCha20 data ciphers, TLS ≥ 1.2 with ECDHE, `tls-crypt` (handshake hidden from scanners), CRL checked on every connect. No compression, no legacy options.
- Secrets hygiene: no plaintext passwords anywhere; TOTP secrets `0400` root-only; nothing sensitive is ever logged; deleted secrets are `shred`-ed.
- Strict permissions: keys `0600` in `0700` dirs; config, PAM file and client profiles `0600`.
- Every change first snapshots the affected files; destructive actions require explicit (default-No) confirmation.

## Uninstall

`Main menu → Uninstall`. It stops/disables the service, removes only the firewall rules *it* created, deletes the PKI/config/PAM/TOTP/YubiKey artifacts, removes the managed system accounts, and optionally purges the packages. A restorable backup archive is left at `/root/openvpn-manager-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz` (contains private keys — keep or delete deliberately).

## Testing

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for the full manual test plan (fresh install, every auth mode end-to-end, revocation, re-run, uninstall) and the syntax/lint CI steps.

## Limitations & future ideas

- One server instance per host (no multi-instance management).
- Server-wide auth mode (per-user *TOTP* is supported via the optional toggle, but cert-only and password users cannot be mixed arbitrarily).
- YubiKey validation needs network access to a validation service (offline YubiKey via challenge-response PAM is not implemented).
- The VPN subnet (`10.8.0.0/24`, `fd42:42:42:42::/112`) is fixed.
- No HA/failover, no LDAP/RADIUS backends (natural next steps: `pam_ldap`, `pam_radius`).
- `nftables`-native backend (currently: firewalld / ufw / iptables).
